Human-elephant conflict (HEC) frequently results in human and elephant mortality, posing
major social justice and conservation concerns across Asia and Africa. While a variety of
interventions have been introduced to mitigate HEC, rigorous evaluations of how they
affect mortality are practically absent. Using a twenty-year data set from Sonitpur district
in Assam, India, we assess whether organized guarding and short-distance drives—which
are used to manage HEC in several countries globally—lead to a reduction in human and
elephant mortality from conflict as intended. Controlling for changes in land use and
economic development, spillover effects, and non-random selection of villages for
intervention, we are unable to conclude whether or not organized guarding provides any
protection against human death due to HEC. Contrary to expectations, the intervention is
associated with an approximately 2.0-2.9 times increase in elephant mortality, with
evidence suggesting elephants may be more likely to suffer an accidental death in villages
where organized guarding occurs. Our study highlights the indispensability of rigorous
evaluations for finding win-win solutions to human-wildlife conflict.

In a typical model of private information and choice under uncertainty, a decision
maker observes a signal, updates her prior beliefs using Bayes rule, and maximizes her
expected utility. If the decision maker’s utility function satisfies the single crossing
property, and the information structure is ordered according to the monotone likeli-
hood ratio, then the comparative statics exhibit monotonicity with respect to signals.
We consider the restrictions placed by this model of signal processing on state con-
ditional stochastic choice data. In particular, we show that this model rationalizes a
state conditional stochastic choice dataset if and only if the dataset itself is ordered
according to the monotone likelihood ratio.
